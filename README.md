# Module 01 Challenge

## Description

An exercise wherein a provided sample of web code was **refactored** to incorporate current best practices, including:
- Use of **HTML5 semantic tags** to logically organize the HTML document.
- Appropriate use of `class` and `id` attributes to reduce/eliminate redundancy in the CSS file.
- Use of accessibility features such as the `alt` attribute for images.
- Incorporation of **comments** into the CSS file to aid in developer readability.

## Usage

The single-page website appears to a front-end user exactly as it did in the original code sample; with the exception of added alt-text, only the structure of the source files have been changed. The page can be viewed [here](https://binderb.github.io/module-01-challenge/) on GitHub Pages.
